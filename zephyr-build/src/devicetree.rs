//! Incorporating Zephyr's devicetree into Rust.
//!
//! Zephyr depends fairly heavily on the devicetree for configuration.  The build system reads
//! multiple DTS files, and coalesces this into a single devicetree.  This tree is output in a few
//! different ways:
//!
//! - Canonical DTS.  There is a single DTS file (`build/zephyr/zephyr.dts`) that contains the final
//! tree, but still in DTS format (the DTB file would have information discarded).
//!
//! - Generated.  The C header `devicetree_generated.h` contains all of the definitions.  This isn't
//! a particularly friendly file to read or parse, but it does have one piece of information that is
//! not represented anywhere else: the mapping between devicetree nodes and their "ORD" index.  The
//! device nodes in the system are indexed by this number, and we need this in order to be able to
//! reference the nodes from Rust.
//!
//! Beyond the ORD field, it seems easier to deal with the DTS file itself.  Parsing is fairly
//! straightforward, as it is a subset of the DTS format, and we only have to be able to deal with
//! the files that are generated by the Zephyr build process.

// TODO: Turn this off.
