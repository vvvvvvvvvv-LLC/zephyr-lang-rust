//! Zephyr low level threads
//!
//! This is a fairly low level (but still safe) interface to Zephyr threads.  This is intended to
//! work the same way as threads are typically done on Zephyr systems, where the threads and their
//! stacks are statically allocated, a code is called to initialize them.
//!
//! In addition, there are some convenience operations available that require allocation to be
//! available.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! Each thread needs a stack associated with it.  The stack and the thread should be defined as
//! follows:
//! ```
//! kobj_defined! {
//!     static MY_THREAD: StaticThread;
//!     static MY_THREAD_STACK: StaticThreadStack<2048>;
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Each of these has a [`init_once`] method that returns the single usable instance.  The
//! StaticThread takes the stack retrieved by take as its argument.  This will return a
//! ThreadStarter, where various options can be set on the thread, and then it started with one of
//! `spawn`, or `simple_spawn` (spawn requires `CONFIG_RUST_ALLOC`).
//!
//! Provided that `CONFIG_RUST_ALLOC` has been enabled (recommended): the read can be initialized as
//! follows:
//! ```
//! let mut thread = MY_THREAD.init_once(MY_THREAD_STACK.init_once(()).unwrap()).unwrap();
//! thread.set_priority(5);
//! let child = thread.spawn(|| move {
//!     // thread code...
//! });
//! ```
//!
//! [`init_once`]: StaticKernelObject::init_once
