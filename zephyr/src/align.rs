//! Alignment
//!
//! Natively, the align attribute in rust does not allow anything other than an integer literal.
//! However, Zephyr will define the external alignment based on numeric constants.  This defines a
//! bit of a trick to enforce alignment of structs to values by defined constants.
//!
//! Thanks to Chayim Refael Friedman for help with this.
