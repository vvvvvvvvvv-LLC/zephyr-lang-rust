//! Device wrappers
//!
//! This module contains implementations of wrappers for various types of devices in zephyr.  In
//! general, these wrap a `*const device` from Zephyr, and provide an API that is appropriate.
//!
//! Most of these instances come from the device tree.

/// Device uniqueness.
///
/// As the zephyr devices are statically defined structures, this `Unique` value ensures that the
/// user is only able to get a single instance of any given device.
///
/// Note that some devices in zephyr will require more than one instance of the actual device.  For
/// example, a [`GpioPin`] will reference a single pin, but the underlying device for the gpio
/// driver will be shared among then.  Generally, the constructor for the individual device will
/// call `get_instance_raw()` on the underlying device.
