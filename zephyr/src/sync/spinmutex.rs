//! Spinlock-based Mutexes
//!
//! The [`sync::Mutex`] type is quite handy in Rust for sharing data between multiple contexts.
//! However, it is not possible to aquire a mutex from interrupt context.
//!
//! This module provides a [`SpinMutex`] which has some similarities to the above, but with some
//! restrictions.  In contrast, however, it is usable from interrupt context.
//!
//! It works by use a spinlock to protect the contents of the SpinMutex.  This allows for use in
//! user threads as well as from irq context, the spinlock even protecting the data on SMP machines.
//!
//! In contract to [`critical_section::Mutex`], this has an API much closer to [`sync::Mutex`] (and
//! as such to [`std::sync::Mutex`].  In addition, it has slightly less overhead on Zephyr, and
//! since the mutex isn't shared, might allow for slightly better use on SMP systems, when the other
//! CPU(s) don't need access to the SyncMutex.
//!
//! Note that `SpinMutex` doesn't have anything comparable to `Condvar`.  Generally, they can be
//! used with a `Semaphore` to allow clients to be waken, but this usage is racey, and if not done
//! carefully can result uses of the semaphore not waking.
