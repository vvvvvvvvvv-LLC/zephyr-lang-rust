    //! [`sync::atomic`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/core/sync/atomic/index.html) module,
    //! these are dependent on the target having atomic instructions, and the types are missing
    //! when the platform cannot support them.  Zephyr, however, does provide atomics on platforms
    //! that don't support atomic instructions, using spinlocks.  In the Rust-embedded world, this
    //! is done through the [`portable-atomic`](https://crates.io/crates/portable-atomic) crate,
    //! which will either just re-export the types from core, or provide an implementation using
    //! spinlocks when those aren't available.
