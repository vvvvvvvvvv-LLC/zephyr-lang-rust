//! Time types designed for Zephyr, inspired by `std::time`.
//!
//! In `std`, there are two primary time types: `Duration`, representing a span of time, and
//! `Instant`, representing a specific point in time. Both have nanosecond precision, which is
//! well-suited to more powerful machines. However, on embedded systems like Zephyr, this precision
//! can lead to performance issues, often requiring divisions whenever timeouts are used.
//!
//! In the Rust embedded ecosystem, the `fugit` crate is commonly used for handling time. It
//! provides both `Duration` and `Instant` types, but with parameters that allow the representation
//! to match the time slice used, enabling compile-time conversion and storing time directly as
//! tick counts.
//!
//! Zephyr manages time in terms of system tick intervals, derived from
//! `sys_clock_hw_cycles_per_sec()`.  This model aligns well with `fugit`, especially when the
//! types are properly parameterized.
//!
//! It's important to note that Rust’s `std::Instant` requires time to be monotonically increasing.
//!
//! Zephyr’s `sys/time_units.h` provides a variety of optimized macros for manipulating time
//! values, converting between human-readable units and ticks, and minimizing divisions (especially
//! by non-constant values).  Similarly, the `fugit` crate offers constructors that aim to result
//! in constants when possible, avoiding costly division operations.

/// absolute time in terms of system ticks.

// The Zephyr `k_timeout_t` represents several different types of intervals, based on the range of
// the value.  It is a signed number of the same size as the Tick here, which effectively means it
// is one bit less.
//
// 0: K_NO_WAIT: indicates the operation should not wait.
// 1 .. Max: indicates a duration in ticks of a delay from "now".
// -1: K_FOREVER: a time that never expires.
// MIN .. -2: A wait for an absolute amount of ticks from the start of the system.
//
// The absolute time offset is only implemented when time is a 64-bit value.  This also means that
// "Instant" isn't available when time is defined as a 32-bit value.

/// Wrapper around the timeout type, so we can implement From/Info.

/// types.  This allows various methods to accept either value, as well as the `Forever` and
/// `NoWait` values defined here.
